    content: |-
      Growing up in French speaking Canada and having moved with my sailboat, to the U.S. in my mid twenties, I'm fluent in French and English. Yes, this means that I do speak with a funny accent, but it also means that I can offer localization services if you or someone you know needs them ;) My background is varied, it includes lots of travels, lifeguarding, nursing school, CNA work, tour guiding on bikes, commercial construction, web development and now QA related work for the past several years. I just had to try it all before I found something that worked for me!
      <br><br>
      Outside of work, you might find me playing improv games, rock climbing, playing guitar, rowing on the water, riding my bike and maybe even bicycle touring at times. Teamwork is something that I enjoy like social bike rides, and as they say, it makes the dream work. Please reach out if you would like to discuss your QA needs!
